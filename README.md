Experimenting with Chip On Board setups for GF180MCU chips, most importantly gf180 Caravel.

Currently contains Pad-out diagrams and KiCad footprints for various GF180 dies. The KiCad footprint library also contains templates (labeled "TEMPLATE_*") which only contain Comment layer drawings showing pad locations of a specific die (pad sizes not to scale).
